          Thank you for visiting Crafting with Cari.....Cari started crafting around 2007 when she went to a friends scrapbook club to support someone else and BOOM, she was hooked.  Cari's first love is her family but in a close second is her crafting.  Cari loves different types of crafting but her top 3 are; 3D projects, card making and water coloring.  She is a Stamping Up demonstrator but you can also find her in her local craft store teaching all sorts of crafting classes from Advent Calendars to different techniques of card making. She hopes you enjoy the projects she is sharing and that you find inspiration!!!  Don't hesitate to email her if you have any questions or would like to place an order.
